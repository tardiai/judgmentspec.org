# Modules

JudgmentSpec is composed of independently versioned modules.

Each module:
- follows semantic versioning
- evolves independently
- declares compatibility with other modules

## Modules

- **JPS** — Judgment Package Schema  
- **JCP** — Judgment Closure Protocol  

Use Releases for stable combinations.
