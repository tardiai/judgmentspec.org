JudgmentSpec is the normative specification set for Judgment Engineering.

It defines canonical structures, protocols, and composition rules
for judgments that must be **completed, closed, and executed**.

---

## Scope (Frozen)

JudgmentSpec defines **only** the following domains:

1. **Structure** — judgment data schemas and validation rules  
2. **Protocol** — closure semantics and state transitions  
3. **Routing & Composition** — selection and dispatch of judgment packages

JudgmentSpec does **not** define methodologies, prompts, or business outcomes.

## Language Notice

JudgmentSpec specifications are **language-agnostic**.

- Normative content is defined by schemas, protocols, and manifests
- Textual descriptions are explanatory only

---

## 中文说明（非规范性）

JudgmentSpec 是用于「判断工程」的**规范集合**。

它只定义三类内容：

1. 判断结构（数据结构与校验）
2. 判断完成/终止协议
3. 判断包的路由与组合规则

所有规范条款以结构与协议为准，  
文字说明仅用于理解，不构成规范约束。
