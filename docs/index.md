# JudgmentSpec

JudgmentSpec is the normative specification set for **judgment structures, closure semantics, and routing/composition**.

## Scope (Frozen)

JudgmentSpec defines only:

1. **Structure** — data schemas and validation rules  
2. **Protocol** — closure states, transitions, and error semantics  
3. **Routing & Composition** — selection/dispatch/combination rules for packages

It does **not** define methods, prompts, business decisions, or outcome guarantees.

## Two Worlds

- **Normative**: MUST be implementable, testable, and verifiable.
- **Non-normative**: Reference models, explanations, examples, presentation.

## Start Here

- **Release (stable reference):** [JS-0.1](releases/JS-0.1/index.md)
- **Modules (independent evolution):** JPS, JCP
