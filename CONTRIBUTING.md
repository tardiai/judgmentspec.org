# Contributing to JudgmentSpec

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **JudgmentSpec**.

JudgmentSpec is a public specification project.
Contributions are welcome, but **not all contributions are normative**.

## Contribution Types

### 1. Issues (Recommended Entry)

Use GitHub Issues to:
- propose changes
- raise ambiguities
- report inconsistencies
- suggest examples or clarifications

Issues are the primary discussion mechanism.

---

### 2. Pull Requests

All changes to `main` must go through Pull Requests.

#### Allowed PRs

- **Non-normative content**
  - examples
  - explanations
  - reference models
  - presentation guidance

- **Editorial fixes**
  - typos
  - formatting
  - clarifications without semantic change

#### Restricted PRs (Require Explicit Approval)

- **Normative specifications**
  - schemas
  - protocols
  - state transitions
  - compatibility rules

Normative changes must:
- clearly state intent
- specify compatibility impact
- reference a prior Issue or Proposal

---

## Normative vs Non-normative

Content is **non-normative by default** unless explicitly marked as normative.

Implementations MUST follow normative specifications.
Examples and references are illustrative only.

---

## Review Process

- All PRs require review before merging.
- Normative changes require approval by the specification maintainer(s).
- Maintainers may request revisions or reject proposals.

---

## What This Repository Is Not

This repository does **not** accept:
- business-specific decision logic
- prompt engineering techniques
- domain-specific best practices
- outcome optimization strategies

Such content belongs outside JudgmentSpec.

---

## Contributing Guidelines

All contributions that affect normative specifications
MUST comply with the "Normative Specification Development SOP"
defined in GOVERNANCE.md.


Thank you for helping keep JudgmentSpec precise, stable, and implementable.
